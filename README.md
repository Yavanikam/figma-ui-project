📚 Library Management Process Analysis & Automation  

This project focuses on analyzing and automating core library workflows to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance the user experience. The design and process flow were created in **Figma** as part of a process optimization initiative.  

📌 Project Overview  
- **Workflow Analysis** → Conducted an end-to-end study of the book borrowing process to identify bottlenecks.  
- **Process Optimization** → Designed improvements to reduce delays and improve resource allocation.  
- **Automation** → Integrated an **automated SMS & email reminder system**, cutting manual effort by ~40%.  
- **Web-based Logging System** → Designed a streamlined interface for book transactions.  
- **Data-driven Insights** → Applied data analysis techniques to reduce wait times and optimize resources.
